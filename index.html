            <p>Hey, my name is Niek Rottier.<br />
                Currently I'm a first year Creative Media and Game Technologies student at Hogeschool Rotterdam.
                Here I learn how to code, do user research and create innovative products.<br />
                This site will show you what I've made and am currently working on to give you a better understanding of what I can do.</p>

            <div class="imgTxtContainer">
                <p>Hopscotch 2.0 is a project based in Hefpark - Rotterdam. This park was assign to our team by the school.
                    The goal was to improve the park, so we got to work. After a whole bunch of concepts we made Hopscotch 2.0.
                    The game includes a site and hardware. The game has different gamemodes and difficulties but all of them make use of
                    tiles that can light up and detect when they are stepped on.</p>

                <p>This information can be passed on to the site to keep track of scores and player turns. I did a lot of work on the site.
                    Left can you see the homepage of the Hopscotch 2.0 site.
                    We had a lot of fun making it, although we couldn't complete it in time.</p>

            <h3>Smart Pushy Objects</h3>
            <p>The Smart Pushy Objects projects where the first assignments I got at Hogeschool Rotterdam.
                First we had to make a Pushy Object. You needed to use the Circuit Playground Express to make a little robot or car to push
                the other out of a ring. I made "Kickstart", a little riding pencil in need of a kickstart.</p>

            <img id="projectsTraycounterImg" src="img/traycounter.jpeg">
            <p><br />Next up we needed to make a smart object. Here I made "TrayCounter" for the restaurant at Ikea. <br />
                This object gave a signal whenever the last tray was picked up. It used a lightsensor to detect this and it was properly styled.</p>
            <p><br />The last assignment was to use everything we learned to make a smart pushy object.<br />
                As team 12 we build the T-12, a tank ready for a fight.
                It ended up moving only slightly and we did not win, but we learned a lot. This series of projects was a great
                kickoff to the year.</p>

        <h3>Planning System</h3>
        <div class="imgTxtContainer">
            <p>The assignment was to build a system to make reservations or plan appointments. <br />
                I made a system for Rottier Maatwerk Meubels (RM2), a one-man custom furniture (and more) business.
                The system is a site, coded with HTML/CSS, JavaScript and PHP. On the site you have a calender and can make appointments.
                The admin can view the appointments and accept or decline them.
                This was my first time working with PHP so I had to learn it from nothing.
                And even though there still were a whole bunch of flaws, I was quite happy with the product.</p>
